note: some work on this library was completed while working on a project under contract
with the Washington Post; ownership status is, at present, unclear but not contested.

This code went ultimately unused for it's original purpose (a simpler approach sufficing),
and is kept here instead, in case it's useful elsewhere or elsewhen.
